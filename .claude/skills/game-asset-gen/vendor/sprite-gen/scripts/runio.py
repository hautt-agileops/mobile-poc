"""Safe run-dir IO shared by the pipeline scripts.

Two concerns live together here because they answer the same question — "what
happens when two sprite-gen processes touch the same run dir at once?" (for
example Claude Code and the Codex app driving the skill in parallel):

- `acquire_run_dir_lock()` — single-writer lock per run dir. SKILL.md forbids
  two workers writing one character folder; this makes the rule enforced
  instead of documentation-only. Writers (extract / compose / export / unpack,
  and the webview's compose/export subprocesses through them) fail loudly with
  the holder's pid instead of silently interleaving output files.
- `atomic_write_text()` / `atomic_save_image()` — temp file in the target dir
  + `os.replace`, so a concurrent reader never observes a half-written
  atlas/manifest/frame.

`curation.json` is intentionally NOT under the lock: the webview already writes
it with the same atomic replace (see `serve_curation.py`), and the compose
scripts read one consistent snapshot of it. Two curator windows on one run dir
remain last-write-wins by design; the lock guards pipeline outputs, not human
edit sessions.
